# el-requisito-con-guion

## What must exist
- un requisito que empieza con guion se puede pasar: `start --light -- "--runs 0 …"` lo escribe tal cual, y sin el `--` el error dice cómo pasarlo
- the refusal that a step cannot start with a dash becomes the narrower rule it meant: a markdown bullet (`- `) doubles the checkbox, and `--runs` duplicates nothing
- the message names the form instead of the flag package's complaint, because "invalid flag" does not tell a human what to type

## Done when
- `odachi start --light -- "--runs 0 se rechaza"` writes a task document whose requirement and step carry that sentence verbatim
- `odachi start --light "--runs 0 se rechaza"` fails with a message that names `odachi start --light -- "<the line>"`
- `odachi plan "- [ ] T1 · algo"` is still refused, and the message says a step does not start with a bullet
- a step text that starts with a single dash is accepted, because the hazard is the bullet and not the dash
- `go test ./...` is green and `odachi check --run "go test ./..."` is green
- `## Unreleased` names it, patch (0270)

## Not included (first version)
- the verb keeps its shape: `--light` still takes one quoted line, and `--` stays Go's own separator instead of a new flag - back when the flag set itself is the question
- a step that starts with a bullet and a space is never accepted: that is the one that doubles the checkbox - back when the renderer stops writing the bullet
- nothing about the other verbs changes: `plan` and `ask` keep their messages, and only `start --light` learns the form - back when another verb takes a free line

## Decisions taken
- The hazard is the bullet, not the dash: `- [ ] T1` pasted whole is what breaks the file, and `--runs 0` protects nothing.
- The error teaches the form it wants: a human reads the message, not the flag package's vocabulary.
